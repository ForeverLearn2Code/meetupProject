meetup scripting project

This is a crude version of a selenium automation script that would allow you to login and simulate some alpha model and save the metadata as well.
The aim of this repo is to serve as a starting point to anyone interested in automating alpha simulation and is by no means a gold standard.
I will make edits to it as and when i get time. In the meanwhile feel free to suggest improvements or raise pull requests as it would help your peers in the general websim userbase.
